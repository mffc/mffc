Pre-marital evaluation and counselling service
==================

Introduction <a name="intro">&nbsp;</a>
-----
Marriage is an important thing in life. From courting to considering marriage, the lovers will think of many issues â€“ their expectations in marriage, compatibility of their characters, management of finances in marriage, family planning, and so on. <br><br>
Over the years, the Marriage Enrichment Retreat (MER) events conducted by MFFC have helped renewing the relationship of many couples.  MFFC also provides comprehensive support and care for lovers going through different stages, from developing a stable relationship during courtship, through making decision and preparing for marriage to the different stages in married life. MFFC's Pre-marital Evaluation and Counselling Service are conducted by professionals. It involves a "PREPARE/ENRICH" course designed for man and woman before getting married and three counselling sessions to help them getting prepared and adjusted.<br><br>
This pre-marital evaluation and counselling service is not to supplant but to complement the pre-marital counselling provided by church pastors to fully equip man and woman for entering into marriage.<br>
