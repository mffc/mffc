Origin of ministry<a name="intro">&nbsp;</a>
--------
The mission of Marriage and Family For Christ (MFFC) is a diversified ministry to strengthen the relationships in marriage and family of Chinese Christians. Since its inception, MFFC has conducted many Marriage Enrichment Retreats in Sydney and other states to provide assistance to many married couples. However, a good marriage depends not only on the work done after getting married. If a foundation of healthy relationship is laid during adolescence or young adulthood, it will pave the way for a successful marriage in the future. This is the need that gives birth of the ministry in Young Christian relationship development camp.<br><br>

Vision<a name="vision">&nbsp;</a>
--------
To nurture and teach young Chinese Christians in Australia to develop relationships in a way that benefits the community and glorifies God.<br><br>
 
Goal<a name="aim">&nbsp;</a>
--------
Through Biblical truth and teaching, to support young Chinese Christians in developing an emotionally healthy relationship in order to lay a strong foundation for marriage relationship in the future.

The Young Christian Relationship Development Camp is a 3-day 2-night event. It involved talks, workshops, testimony sharing, discussion groups, and many diversified activities. Through interaction, meditation, and studying biblical truths, the participants can explore the challenges they are facing.<br><br>

This camp provides a platform for young Christians to explore how to apply biblical principles to dealing with issues they encounter from being a single to being married. It covers subjects such as different stages of courtship and its issues in communication, what it means to be a single, knowing oneself, different perspectives of man and woman on courtship, the pain of breaking off, facing temptation of sex, appropriate attitudes towards marriage. These will help the campers find the correct attitude towards courtship in this day and age polluted by misinformation from the media. <br><br>
