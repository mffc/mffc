Core value<a name="philosophy">&nbsp;</a>
--------
Want nothing for oneself, but give everything to the Lord. Live out a life to impact life in ministry.

Philosophy and Spirit
----------
* Life with life fellowship, serving together with gifts
* Life more important than gifts, relationship more important than ministry (Ephesians 2:10; Isaiah 64:8)
* Life before ministry, characters more important than exteriors.
* Submission before mission (1 Samuel 15:22)
* Team more important than individual. Esteem others better than oneself. (Philippians 2:3-4)
* The Lord must be greater. I must become less. (John 3:30)
